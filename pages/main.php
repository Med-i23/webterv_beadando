                <h2>Origins</h2>
                Ergo was founded by a few high school friends back in 2018 in Peacefull County.
                It started with a local school tournament, and it hasn't stopped since.
                We were playing at the time with one team and only played CSGO. In 2020 due to Covid outbreak we are forced to play house matches with small prizes.
                But it hasn't stopped our ability to grow. We have made two more teams in two different games. In November 2020 we have formed our
                Valorant and Rocket League divisions. They have been striving ever since. As of today, our teams have won 8 tournaments and 24 small cups
                divided between teams, AND we are opening a cat division too. We are looking forward for our future and hope you can tag along with us in this journey.
