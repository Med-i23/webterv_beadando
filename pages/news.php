            <h2>Team CSGO wins semi-finals against Crozhair gaming</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-highlighter__first">
                Our national csgo team was successfull in competing in the Cherubaka 2023 Spring-Cup semi-finals and winning against the competition. The CS:GO team of Ergo was
                in a tough spot because of reported infightings and disagreements in B-rush tactics, but in the end they managed to wipe the enemy teams.
                The final match against Crozhair gaming in the 3 round map point system was fought out gloriously, some reports even state that few players mouses started to catch on fire.
                -talking about burn damage- But Ergo came out on top 3 to 2 and therefore taking home the dub and an invitation to the grand finals in May. We asked the teams coach, Koaxk √Åbel
                for some insight:

                       <q>To be honest I never doubted my boys. We trained hard and we played hard. Surely there were some misunderstandings, but the important is that its in the bag.
                        After a 3-day bender we will be going back to the keyboards and train hard for the finals. GG go next!</q>

                We will be looking forward for the matches and hopefully see fans there too!

            <h2>The new member of team Valorant in the Finals!  </h2>
                <p>
                The recent rumors about one of the members of team Valorant, Eros passing the mantle was just rumors until this morning. Eros has decided to quit the team due to
                personal affairs and health problems. The team members state that it's been a long time coming since Eros was known to have back problems due to his massive carrying of the team.
                Eros told us that he will continue gaming, and he's about to start a new streaming channel, so you can catch him there. We wish him well and hope he will find happiness in the
                next chapter of his life. But this begs the question: Who will replace Eros in the Valorant Challengers tournament in the summer season? We are conforming that team Valorant
                has found its new member but their reveal will have to wait till next month. The team will continue to train with its new recruit.
