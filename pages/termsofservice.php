        <h4>FAIR USE</h4>

        Ergo Inc. is committed to respecting the intellectual property rights of others and complying with applicable
        copyright laws. We believe in the importance of fair use, which allows for limited use of copyrighted material
        without the permission of the copyright owner. Fair use is a critical element of creativity, innovation, and
        free expression.
        <ol>
            <li value="1">1. What is Fair Use?
                Fair use is a legal doctrine that allows for the limited use of copyrighted material for purposes such
                as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. The fair use analysis
                involves a balancing test of four factors:</li>

            <li value="1">2. The purpose and character of the use</li>

            <li value="1">3. The nature of the copyrighted work</li>

            <li value="1">4. The amount and substantiality of the portion used</li>

            <li value="1">5. The effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work</li>

            <li value="1">6. How We Apply Fair Use
                Ergo Inc. is committed to complying with applicable copyright laws and respecting the intellectual
                property rights of others. We believe in the importance of fair use as a fundamental aspect of
                creativity, innovation, and free expression. We may use copyrighted material in our content, marketing
                materials, or other materials for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching,
                scholarship, or research.

                In applying fair use, we consider the four factors of the fair use analysis and strive to use only the
                amount of copyrighted material that is necessary to achieve our purpose. We also strive to use the
                material in a transformative manner that adds new meaning, expression, or understanding to the original
                work.</li>

            <li value="1">7. Reporting Copyright Infringement
                If you believe that your copyrighted work has been used in a manner that constitutes copyright
                infringement, please notify us in writing as soon as possible. Your notification should include the
                following:</li>

            <li value="1">8. A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;</li>

            <li value="1">9. A description of the material that you claim is infringing and where it is located on our
                website or webshop;</li>

            <li value="1">10. Your contact information, including your name, address, telephone number, and email
                address;</li>

            <li value="1">11. A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the copyrighted
                material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;</li>

                notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright
                owner.</li>
