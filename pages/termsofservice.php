        FAIR USE

        Ergo Inc. is committed to respecting the intellectual property rights of others and complying with applicable copyright laws. We believe in the importance of fair use, which allows for limited use of copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner. Fair use is a critical element of creativity, innovation, and free expression.

        1.1. What is Fair Use?
        Fair use is a legal doctrine that allows for the limited use of copyrighted material for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. The fair use analysis involves a balancing test of four factors:

        1.2. The purpose and character of the use

        1.3. The nature of the copyrighted work

        1.4. The amount and substantiality of the portion used

        1.5. The effect of the use on the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work

        1.6. How We Apply Fair Use
        Ergo Inc. is committed to complying with applicable copyright laws and respecting the intellectual property rights of others. We believe in the importance of fair use as a fundamental aspect of creativity, innovation, and free expression. We may use copyrighted material in our content, marketing materials, or other materials for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.

        In applying fair use, we consider the four factors of the fair use analysis and strive to use only the amount of copyrighted material that is necessary to achieve our purpose. We also strive to use the material in a transformative manner that adds new meaning, expression, or understanding to the original work.

        1.7. Reporting Copyright Infringement
        If you believe that your copyrighted work has been used in a manner that constitutes copyright infringement, please notify us in writing as soon as possible. Your notification should include the following:

        1.8. A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;

        1.9. A description of the material that you claim is infringing and where it is located on our website or webshop;

        1.10. Your contact information, including your name, address, telephone number, and email address;

        1.11. A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;

        1.12. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

        Conclusion
        Fair use is a critical element of creativity, innovation, and free expression. Ergo Inc. is committed to complying with applicable copyright laws and respecting the intellectual property rights of others. We believe in the importance of fair use and will continue to apply it in our content, marketing materials, and other materials for purposes such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.
